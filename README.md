### AI Adoption and Management Framework (AI-AMF)

The AI Adoption and Management Framework (AI-AMF), developed by WhiteGloveAI, is a 
transformative methodology that guides organizations from the conceptualization of AI to full-scale 
operational integration. The framework is characterized by a multi-layer, systematic approach 
ensuring that enterprises align with evolving industry standards such as ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, 
OWASP guidelines, MITRE frameworks, the EU AI Act, and Databricks’ AI Security Framework (DASF). 
Leveraging the innovative vCAIO (virtual/fractional Chief AI Officer) model, the AI-AMF not only 
supports technical and operational excellence but also addresses key strategic, ethical, and 
governance challenges.
